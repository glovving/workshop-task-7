# Workshop task 7
For this workshop I have forked Siennas workshop 2 repository, here is a link to hepage -> (https://github.com/siennabienna/workshop_2)
# Objects and Simulation 

## Goals for this workshop:
- Build a simulation of a real or imagined entity or environment.
- Experiment with random walks and/or particle systems in your sketch.
- Make a new repository for your p5.js project on your GitHub account, publish your sketch as a webpage, and include a README file in your repository with a URL to the webpage along with documentation of your work.

## Notes and Planning
Here are some notes I took during the demonstration (left), and my initial sketch for what I wanted my website to look like(right):

My plan was to fork a classmates repository, and create a background image with pieces of their code that I would modify to meet my needs.
Then I would have my walkers on top of that background + one more extra functionality.

## Forking Repository
I asked one of my classmates - Sienna if I could use fork one of their repositories.

Once I got permission, I forked their workshop task 2 repository into my workshop task 7 repository, I then downloaded that repository and opened it in vscode to work on.

After this I read through the code to figure out how it worked, then I created a new bg class object, copying over, then editing fragments of code I wanted to use.

My new bg class object ^
I wrote my bg class to be adaptable to and window size, so I used the windowWidth and windowHeight of the canvas as references for the x and y points and limits for circle generation, rather than the set points in Siennas original sketch, as that had a set canvas size.
